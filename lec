Graph Terminology 
-----------------
Nodes/Vertexes/vertices -- the data components of the Graph
Edges -- the connections between the Nodes

Directed vs undirected graphs

Directed graps have one-way Edges
Undirected graphs all edges are two-way

Cyclic - there is at least one "loop"
Acyclic - there are no loops at all

Dense Graphs - high ratio of edges to nodes,, nodes are connected to many other nodes
SParse Graphs - nodes are connected to few other nodes

Weighted Graphs - edges have associated weights
Unweighted - edges do not, are all the same weights
